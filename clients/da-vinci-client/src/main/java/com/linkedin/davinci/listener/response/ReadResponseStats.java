/**
 * This class is used to accumulate stats associated with a read response.
 *
 * This container is purely for metrics-related work, and should not be used to store any state which is functionally
 * required to achieve the service's goal. Contrast with {@link ReadResponse}, which wraps this one.
 *
 * The reason to keep them separate is that the state used for metrics has a slightly longer lifespan than that used for
 * functional purposes, since we record metrics at the very end, after the response is sent back. This allows us to free
 * up the functional state sooner, even while we need to hang on to the metrics state.
